# Nenad Nikolić

## A bit about me

Hi, I am Nenad. I was born and raised in Belgrade, Serbia. I fell in love with programming the moment i wrote `printf("Hello world")`. It's funny cause it's true! Anyways, it's been about 15 years since then and i've developed quite a career as a software engineer. Most of which I spent in Germany, where i also live now. Apart from work, i am a devoted husband and father of two. I speak English and Deutsch fluently. My mother tounge is Serbian.

## My work experience

### Software architect/Devops @ EBF Gmbh (2018-current)

In this role, on top of the Software developer responsibilities, i acquired the skill of driving technological and organisational change.

I've helped transition the team (about 15 devs) from having various different deployment and development procedures into a single one: We deploy using docker images and we do image propagation to get to production.

In order to achieve this, i needed to advocate change both internally in the dev team, and in the Infrastructure department, while implementing the needed changes to facilitate the transition.

This required me to sharpen both my devops and my people skills.


### Software developer @ EBF Gmbh (2015-2018)

In this role i've learned that taking initiative is important if i want to see change.

I'm mostly proud of meeting the deadlines and helping land two huge customers on the project i was working on. 

Working in this role yielded the [Spring granular permissions](https://github.com/ebf/spring-granular-permissions) library.

Also, i've helped set some standards that were new in the team:
- writing unit and integration tests
- providing documentation 
- going to lunch together... yes this wasn't a thing...

These all became the norm and still are. Yes, the team was in a poor condition.


### Software engineer @ Elastic.io (2014-2015) 

I joined Elastic.io as a first on-site dev. The startup was consisting of a CEO, CTO, an intern, me and a growing remote team in Ukraine.

Apart from delivering node.js and Ember.js code, this position involved writing customer documentation, designing and discussing complex technical solutions with the Cs, taking the role of scrum master and many others i probably can't remember. Overtime was normal. 

The product was, and still is, an iPaaS. Integration platform as a service.

I was generally proud to work on this product and with that great team. I left because of financial reasons.


### Android App developer @ Net-M (2013-2014) 

This position involved writing an Android app and some work on the app gateway backend.

This was a position i didn't thrive in. I didn't like the project, and i found android development awkward. However, i still managed to deliver the project after which i left the company.

This was my first and only experience with Android.


### Frontend developer @ Net-M (2011 - 2013)

During time in this position i relocated from Belgrade, Serbia to Düsseldorf, Germany. It was my first full time job as a developer. After working with Ruby on Rails for a while i was getting introduced to Java's Tapestry framework for component based web development. 

In the first phase of this job i was working mostly on projects for customers, assembling mobile web portals using the component collection provided by the architecture team.

After the architect, who was also the Tapestry advocate, left the company (to start Elastic.io), i was the one to take over the maintenance of the component collection codebase.

I'm mostly proud of the growth in this position. I managed to grow from a junior mindset into a medior. Started practicing TDD and understanding where and when abstractions make sense.

Once i felt like i'm not learning anymore i requested a transfer to another department in an attempt to stay with the company.


### Freelancer (2009 - 2011)

At this time i was finishing up my studies while also working part time as a System administrator in a small bookkeeping agency and doing some software development on the side.

I'm mostly proud of implementing a small Content management system + website for a Hiking community in Belgrade, Serbia. It involved an anonymous, regular user and admin user role, all with different segments of the UI to see and manage. Admins could publish news, hiking events and hike reports.
